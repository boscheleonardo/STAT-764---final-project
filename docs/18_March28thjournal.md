# 18th class - March 28th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

In today's class, I could work on my class project, and something new I learned was how to run a Generalized Additive Model using Bayesian, with brms package in R, it seems simple to implement and give us a powerful output, including uncertainty, which is something harder to get by running GAM in mgcv package. In addition to that, I learned how to add the block effect in my GAM model and check the difference between the model fitting with and without it.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

I'd say that something I am struggling with is understanding the difference between outputs depending on the function we use to get the predictions, such as predict(), and posterior_predict().
