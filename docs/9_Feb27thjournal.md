# 11th class - February 27th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Something new I learned in today's class was the multivariate normal distribution and how we can use it in spatial-temporal analysis. In addition to that, the part covering potential correlation matrices to be included in the multivariate normal distribution was great to better understand which correlation is more suitable for each case based on the correlation we have among variables.  


2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Something I am struggling to understand is the Gaussian correlation function, I mean I could get that it is basically a mathematical function that helps us to describe how two variables are correlated, but how to interpret its results based on the output we got is something I will need to read and understand better.
