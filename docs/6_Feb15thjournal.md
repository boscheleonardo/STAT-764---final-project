# 8th class - February 15th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Something new for me in today's class was how we can work with the Parameter Model (prior), through Whooping crane examples we set reasonable priors to our model, which was great to better understand how this process works and what should we consider. In addition to that, simulating data from prior predictive distribution and rejection sampling were both new for me.


2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Something I am struggling to understand is the R coding part, I mean adding the mathematical model we selected and distribution into R. I would say that most of the codes seem okay, I can understand, but there are some specific points like more mathematical ones that I am not familiar with.
