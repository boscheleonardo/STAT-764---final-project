# 9th class - February 20th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

I'd say that something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours was how and from where we can download weather (rainfall) data. In addition to that, some features of the sf package were also new to me. The idea of first setting our goals and what we wanna make inferences on before start analyzing your data was an important point, it has been mentioned in previous classes, but it is always good to keep it in mind and have clear objectives before exploring deeply a dataset. 

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Something I am struggling to understand is about how to deal with NA, and how are the implications indeed to your choice. Mainly because of the extreme rainfall example, this topic came up, and in my point of view, it is not clear what is the best/preferable approach in this scenario.
