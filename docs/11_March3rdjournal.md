# 13th class - March 5th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Today's class was a great opportunity to practice concepts we've seen the last couple of weeks, mainly applying them to activity 2. I learned how to fit a simple kriging model to my elevation dataset, which I am working on to create an elevation map for a field trial, aiming to get better insights on how we should place the blocks and avoid areas with too low elevation. In addition to that, it was cool to see many different models other friends were trying to implement to their elevation data.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Something I am struggling with is fitting a second order polynomial regression, I guess the model is not converging, which is why I get NA for the second-order term. I'm trying to fix it, otherwise I plan to stop by some office hours this week.
