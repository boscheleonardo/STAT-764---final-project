# 10th class - February 22th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Something new I learned in class was regarding the intro to GIS, I've been using some GIS data like shapefiles and points, however, the review from today's class was great to better interpret them. In addition to that, transformations and coordinate reference system discussion were also important to identify potential units used in this world and how to deal with them.


2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Something I am struggling to understand is the Gaussian process part of the class, in my opinion, it was too fast and we did not have enough time to explore it, since it is an important aspect present when working with the Hierarchical Bayesian Framework.
