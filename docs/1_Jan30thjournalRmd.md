# 3rd class - January 30th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Today’s class and the assigned readings (pages 11-14 in Wikle et al., 2019) helped me to get a better understanding of the concept of Hierarchical Statistical Models, how it is defined, and how it works. It was well covered how flexible they are in terms of assumptions manipulation aiming to improve model performance. In addition to that, its ability to portray uncertainty rather than just estimation was also a key point in my opinion. If we have additional information that might help improve our statistical model, why not use it to make better inferences? Another interesting point was that for dealing with space-time data most of the basic approach won’t work unless you really specify important assumptions (allowed in more sophisticated models) that are able to improve your model performance and consequently make meaningful inferences. 

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours: 

I am struggling to understand at this point is, how can we use those assumptions to change model performance? I mean, how it exactly works, how am I supposed to add additional information as a prior? What is related/should be considered in my selection in terms of probability distribution for a given prior? I understand that these topics have not been fully covered so far, and I am looking forward to attending the next classes and getting to know more about it.
