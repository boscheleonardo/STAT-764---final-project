# 19th class - April 2nd {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

I'd say that something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours was how to deal with spatial-temporal models for disease data, I mean the example from today's class was a great opportunity to understand the base rules and how we should think to perform our analysis, considering the spatial-temporal component and factors that might impact the result, such as data regarding surrounding areas.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

I am struggling to understand every piece of the three different empirical hierarchical models used for model fitting in the Bird Cherry-oat Aphid example.
