# 25th class - April 23th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Today's class was a great opportunity to work on a spatio-temporal model fitting, using the Earthquake data and KS oil and gas well data. I'd say that something new I learned was regarding the use of IPPP (Inhomogeneous Poisson Point Process) when modeling spatio-temporal data like Earthquake.


2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

I'd say that something I am struggling with is understanding the difference between the first and the second model performed in the analyses, in my mind both seem to use the spatio-temporal effect intine model, not only the second model.
