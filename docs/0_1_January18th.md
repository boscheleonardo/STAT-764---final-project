# (PART\*) JOURNALS
# 1st class - January 18th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours:
In the recent class session and through the assigned readings (pages 1-15 in Wikle et al., 2019), I gained a profound understanding of the significance of spatial-temporal analysis and its relevance in various fields, particularly within the agricultural world where I am located. Basically, all the data we collect has a temporal and spatial component included, which underscores the importance of delving into spatial-temporal analysis to extract key insights. In addition to that, I am excited about the potential applications of spatial-temporal analysis in my work and look forward to incorporating these insights into my future projects as a master's student.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:
At this early stage of the semester, following the introductory class session, I find myself without any specific challenges or difficulties in understanding the material. The initial class primarily focused on providing an overview and setting the stage for the upcoming topics we will explore throughout the semester. It involved insightful explanations about the structure and expectations of the course.
