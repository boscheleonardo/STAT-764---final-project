# 6th class - February 8th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours was the Bayesian Hierarchical modeling framework, while it wasn't entirely new to me, I found that my understanding improved significantly. The concepts became clearer, and I feel more confident in my ability to use/apply this framework in my data analysis. In addition to that, what is exactly the idea behind the posterior distribution (uncertainty about parameters) and posterior predictive distribution (making predictions about future observations based on updated knowledge) were well covered in my opinion. 

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Since the last class covered a review of mathematical models and explored the example regarding the whooping crane, I didn't encounter any specific struggles, one area that piqued my curiosity and left me pondering was the process of selecting a distribution for a particular data model. I find myself wondering about the criteria we should consider when making this decision and how we can test different distributions to arrive at the most appropriate one.
