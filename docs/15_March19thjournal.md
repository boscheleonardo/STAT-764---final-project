# 15th class - March 19th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

In today's class, we could review what was covered so far, distributions, hierarchical modeling, and model building process. I'd say that what I learned in class within the past 24 hours was mostly related to the mgcv package, how to use it, and the applications it presents.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Something I am struggling with is deciding/choosing appropriate PDFs or PMFs for the data, and parameters models, I think that the following classes, which will cover more examples on this, are going to help me to clarify and get a better understanding.
