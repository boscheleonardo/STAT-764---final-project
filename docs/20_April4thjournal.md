# 20th class - April 4th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

In today's class, I could work on my class project, and something new I learned was how to use a machine learning algorithm (extreme gradient boosting) to assess features importance. Using the xgboost algorithm I could select the 5 most important variables driving corn yield response to nitrogen nutrition index. In addition to that, I used a multinomial logistic model to predict the probabilities of the different possible clusters based on the type of response, flat, plateau response, and non-plateau response.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

I'd say that something I am struggling with is to improve the multinomial logistic model outcome, to be able to show the effect of the most important variables selected through xgboost within each cluster.
