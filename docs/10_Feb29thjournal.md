# 12th class - February 29th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

I'd say that today's class was great for revising/learning how to apply a hierarchical model in spatial analysis, mainly through the extreme rainfall example covered in class. Starting from the exploratory data analysis (steps and what could we explore) and going to statistical data analysis, testing different models, such as a hierarchical linear model with two error terms, and comparing with a non-hierarchical approach. In addition to that, how to make spatial predictions at each pixel was something new for me. 


2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Something I am struggling to understand is how to properly write my model inside a function, once you have specified it with all parameters and distributions. For example in the extreme rainfall analysis, how to translate the data model and process model into the gls function in R.
