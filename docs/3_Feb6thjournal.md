# 5th class - February 6th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Todayâ€™s class was a nice oportunity to review basic concepts on probability distribution function, mainly normal distribution. In adition to that, how to make my own function for the PDF (using the exponential distribution as an example) was something new for me, I think it helped to get a better understanding on how to move from mathematical equations into function for the PDF of any distribution. The difference between the mean and the expected value using the maximum "likeliehood" approach might be something simpels but I have never heard about it before, which was great to start thinking and understanding more deeply.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours: 

I'd say that the part of the class about mathematical model rivew, specially regarding difference equations (works on discrete functions) and differential equations (works on continuous) was not clear for me and I need to look for materials to study and get familiar with it. Something I need to explore more is how to write mathematical equations in R, it would be more a programming skill that I need to practice and improve it.
