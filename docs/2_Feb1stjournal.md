# 4th class - February 1st {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

I think the explanation about how to change model assumptions was great, the example using marathon data for fitting a model helped a lot, at least in my mind is clearer now how can we manage it. In addition to that, I would say that the point about removing outliers was kind of new the way it was covered, I mean thinking that we need to take into account that the error aspect might be affecting all data, not only those odd points. Lastly, I could understand better what prediction, forecasts, and hindcasts mean as a model purpose.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours: 

I am struggling to understand at this point, why adding more complexity to our model might help on predicting but not on forecasting and hindcasting. What makes it miss the ability to extrapolate beyond the range of the data, in other words, what is the explanation for this to be happening. Communicating uncertainty is another key point I need to get a better understanding of.
