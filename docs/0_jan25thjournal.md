# 2nd class - January 25th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours:

One insightful aspect from today's class was the marathon example, which served as a valuable tool not only for revisiting polynomial regression concepts, but also to offer a comprehensive perspective on model assumptions, performance, and the examination of the line of best fit to ensure its alignment with real-world observations. 

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Regarding something I am struggling to understand are probability distributions and mathematical models, since I have never taken any mathematical/basic stat classes (my first one was STAT 705). In my opinion this is something I will need to invest some time to get a better understanding and consolidate basic principles that are essential for statistical models. 

in my opinion these are important points for statistical models which I will need to improve for sure.
