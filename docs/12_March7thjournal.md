# 14th class - March 7th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Today's class was great to explore and learn alternatives for modeling elevation data. We saw many different approaches, such as regression trees, gradient boosting, and support vector machines.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Since the class was more about practicing and working on activity 2, I do not have anything special to emphasize about something I am struggling with.
