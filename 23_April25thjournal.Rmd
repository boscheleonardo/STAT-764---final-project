# 26th class - April 25th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

In today's class, we had the opportunity to work on activity 3. Mainly checking the model fitting results and measuring the performance of predictions from each model.


2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

I'd say that something I am struggling with is writing out the three statistical models using appropriate notation and describing each component of the model using words.
