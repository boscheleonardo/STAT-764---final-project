# 21st class - April 9th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours was mostly related to the spatio-temporal models used for model fitting in the Bird cherry-oat aphid abundance example. The class was a great opportunity to get a better understanding of each piece of the model, especially the first and second one, using Poisson and negative binomial distributions respectively, I could also understand better the reason behind testing those two distributions and why they make sense for this kind of data. 

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

I'd say that something I am struggling with is understanding the third model tested in the bird cherry-oat aphid example.
