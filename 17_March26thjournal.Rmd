# 17th class - March 26th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

I'd say that something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours were techeniques for model checking/comparison, mainly the idea of collecting more data or using part of the data that was not used for model fitting to check predictive accuracy. In addition to that, the scoring rules presented and performed in today's class were great to remember and practice model comparison.

2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

Something I am struggling with is which scoring rule is more appropiate depending on the model we are fitting, I'd say that this is something I need to invest some time and read about it.
