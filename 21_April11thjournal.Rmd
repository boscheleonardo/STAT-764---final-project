# 22nd class - April 11th {-}

1. Something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours: 

In today's class, we had the opportunity to work on activity 3. I would say that something new I learned in class within the past 24 hours was mainly related to how to fit the three different spatio-temporal models covered in class to the abundance of English grain aphid data. In addition to that, I could also measure the performance of predictions from each model.


2. Something I am struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours:

I'd say that something I am struggling with is regarding the concurvity measurement of each model. This is something I need to double check and read about it to get to know better.
